The Gamut
    - The most important choices
    - Pointing the camera

Traversing the Gamut
    - Randomness etc


Tips:

    - Forget about "purity"
    - It's okay to break your own rules. Also consider how the rules can be used to break your expectations.
    - Simple systems often produce the most interesting and complex behavior.
    - Embrace errors. Explore bugs before fixing them, if at all.

Topics:

    - Computational creativity
    - Euclidean rhythms
    - Counterpoint and part writing as algorithmic writing
    - Simple composable systems vs monolithic algorithms
        - Algorithmic complexity orthogonal to musical complexity
    - Algorithmic / procedural / serial / process music term equiv
    - Band in a box / automatic accompaniment / didactic systems
    - Idiomatic reverse engineering (EMI/Cope, pop music generators etc)
    - Aleatoric approaches
        - Working with randomness
        - Constrainted randomness
            - Cageian gamuts
        - Random distributions
        - Working with chaos and fractals
        - Emergent systems
            - Flocking
            - Cellular automata
        - Weighted randomness: markov chains
    - Process music (Reich, Part et al)
    - Sublime bugs (and the diminishing returns of "correctness")
    - Analytical approaches
        - Feature extraction from audio
        - Symbolic analysis (eg mingus lib)
        - Machine learning / black box approaches
        - Algorithm as improvisor
        - Algorithm as composer
    - Data-driven / "sonification" approaches
        - Sensors / realtime environmental data
        - Fixed media (eg books, videos, etc)
        - Historical / archival / research data
        - Network data
        - Physical models as data simulation (SIGGRAPH particle synthesis)
    - Mapping data
        - Working at different time scales
            - Algorithms at the level of the frame
            - Algorithms as parametric control within an event
            - Algorithms at the level of the event, phrase, section, etc
        - Constraint
        - There is *always* a mapping (eg a compositional decision) even with machine learning systems
